divertion=FoxTester has detected that you have a Firefox version installed in the /opt directory that is set as default, using a dpkg divertion. Due to a recommendation from Ubuntu developers, FoxTester will remove the divertion and copy the file /opt/firefox/firefox to /usr/local/bin/firefox. In order to do that, a terminal will be opened and your password will be required.
